I am still working on this. So the idea of this project is to create a budget tracker in java.

So how does it work?

As soon as you run the code, it creates a folder according to the current month and asks you for your today's spend. It will then create a text file writing all of it. Then it will calculate the total and add today's spent in another file which will be containing the total spent of the whole month.

P.S.: It will skip the creation of new folders and files, if it already exists and intead write on the existing file.
